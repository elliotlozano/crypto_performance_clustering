## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For reading data into a DataFrame.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) - For embedding plots in the application.

* [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - For scientific computing in Python.

* [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - For providing a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

* [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) - For supplying classes for manipulating dates and times.

* [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - For data interchange.

* [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html) - For sending HTTP/1.1 requests.

* [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - For reading key-value pairs from a .env file and setting them as environment variables.

* [alpaca_trade_api](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/) - For collecting relevant price data from Alpaca Trade API.

* [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) - For accurate timezone calculations.
